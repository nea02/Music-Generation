# Music-Generation

The project focuses on developing an innovative system for automated music generation using deep learning techniques and advanced statistical analysis. The primary goal is to create original music compositions inspired by the styles of renowned composers, including Chopin, Beethoven, Haydn, and Liszt. 

The project begins with a comprehensive dataset integration and preprocessing phase, where MIDI files from the selected composers are converted into a suitable numerical representation for model training. A key aspect of our approach involves leveraging statistical methods, such as cosine similarity analysis, to identify optimal composer combinations based on shared musical features. Through this analysis, we determine the most harmonious composer pairs, such as Beethoven and Liszt or Chopin, Beethoven, and Liszt, to guide the music generation process.

The core of our system lies in the deep learning model training using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. These models are trained on the preprocessed datasets to learn the selected composer combinations' intricate musical patterns and styles. The trained LSTM model is then utilized to dynamically generate new music sequences that blend the musical characteristics of the identified composer pairs. 

Additionally, the system incorporates a user-friendly interface where users can interactively select composer combinations, provide feedback on generated music, and download compositions based on their preferences. Evaluation and quality control mechanisms ensure that the generated music meets certain standards of quality and authenticity. The project aims to democratize music composition by offering users a creative and personalized experience in exploring the rich musical heritage of iconic composers through automated music generation.
